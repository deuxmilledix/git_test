- 1: to check the remote terminals 
(base) zhuo@zhuo-Inspiron-5579:~/Documents/git_test_3$ git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/deuxmilledix/git_test.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/deuxmilledix/git_test.git (push)


- 2: when I did some modification or addings, if I need to push this modification on github
>git push -u origin master

- 3: then if anyone modified this file remotely from others terminals, and we need to fetch the modification before adding ours
>git pull origin master

- 4: to receive the modification from remote terminal without affecting our working file, then you need fetch
>git fetch origin

- 5: after the fetch command, if you want to affect the modification to your working file, then you need merge
>git merge origin/master
